# Final Project
This repository contains the source files I used to create my application, a report of my research, and links to websites that I found useful.

* The application is a cross-platform audio spectrum analyzer. Some features include:
    * 1/3, 1/6, and 1/12th octave views.
    * Apply an arbitrary octave slope to the graph.
    *

* I made this project using the JUCE framework, which specializes in creating audio applications for use in music.
